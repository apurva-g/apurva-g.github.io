> Hello, my name is Apurva.I am a graduate student at Boston University, studying Master of Science in Computer Science.
I am interested in web-based application development. Before pursuing my graduate studies I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering.
I believe myself as a quick learner. I spend my free time playing badminton, biking and reading fictional books.
I like to be called as Apurva.
